This kernel module implements the user interface of the nanonap. To use this
module, the kernel has to support the nanonap first. You can either patch
the kernel(Linux 4.3.0) with "./kernel_nanonap.patch" or clone the "BATCH" branch
of a forked Linux repository(https://github.com/yangxi/linux).

"make; sudo insmode nanonap.ko;" loads the nanonap module. It creates a device
at "/dev/nanonap". "test_nanonap.c" demonstrates how to open this device and issue nanonap
calls. "make user" compile "test_nanonap.c" to

Nanonap allocates a per-cpu sleeping flag. When any CPU becomes idle, it touches the paired
CPU's sleeping flag, so it wakes up the napping task if there was a tasking napping on the
paired CPU.
