This kernel module exports two kernel per-CPU software signals:
shim_curr_task shows the current running task's tid and pid.
shim_curr_syscall shows whether the current running task is in the system call,
if it is in, reports the system call number.  How kernel generates the two
signals could be found either from "../nanonap/kernel_nanonap.patch" or
from the "BATCH" branch of a forked Linux repository(https://github.com/yangxi/linux).

"make; sudo insmod ksignal.ko;" loads this module. It creates two files:
"/sys/module/ksignal/parameters/task_signal" shows the physical addresses of each CPU's shim_curr_task signal physical address.
"/sys/module/ksignal/parameters/syscall_signal" shows the physical addresses of each CPU's shim_curr_syscall signal physicall address.

"make user" generates "sample_ksignal" which demonstrates how to map the kernel physical address to user address and sample CPU0's shim_curr_task signal at user level.
